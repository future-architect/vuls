## Abstract

For a system administrator, having to perform security vulnerability analysis and software update on a daily basis can be a burden.
To avoid downtime in a production environment, it is common for a system administrator to choose not to use the automatic update option provided by the package manager and to perform update manually.
This leads to the following problems.

- The system administrator will have to constantly watch out for any new vulnerabilities in NVD (National Vulnerability Database) or similar databases.
- It might be impossible for the system administrator to monitor all the software if there are a large number of software packages installed in the server.
- It is expensive to perform analysis to determine the servers affected by new vulnerabilities. The possibility of overlooking a server or two during analysis is there.

Vuls is a tool created to solve the problems listed above. It has the following characteristics.

- Informs users of the vulnerabilities that are related to the system.
- Informs users of the servers that are affected.
- Vulnerability detection is done automatically to prevent any oversight.
- A report is generated on a regular basis using CRON or other methods. to manage vulnerability.

### Scan mode

[Fast Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-fast-scan.html)

- Scan without root privilege, no dependencies
- Almost no load on the scan target server
- Offline mode scan with no internet access. (CentOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat, and Ubuntu)

[Fast Root Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-fast-root-scan.html)

- Scan with root privilege
- Almost no load on the scan target server
- Detect processes affected by update using yum-ps (Amazon Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, and RedHat)
- Detect processes which updated before but not restarting yet using checkrestart of debian-goodies (Debian and Ubuntu)
- Offline mode scan with no internet access. (CentOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat, and Ubuntu)

### [Remote, Local scan mode, Server mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-remote-local.html)

[Remote scan mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-remote-scan.html)

- User is required to only set up one machine that is connected to other target servers via SSH

[Local scan mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/architecture-local-scan.html)

- If you don't want the central Vuls server to connect to each server by SSH, you can use Vuls in the Local Scan mode.

[Server mode](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-server.html)

- First, start Vuls in server mode and listen as an HTTP server.
- Next, issue a command on the scan target server to collect software information. Then send the result to Vuls Server via HTTP. You receive the scan results as JSON format.
- No SSH needed, No Scanner needed. Only issuing Linux commands directory on the scan target server.

### **Dynamic** Analysis

- It is possible to acquire the state of the server by connecting via SSH and executing the command.
- Vuls warns when the scan target server was updated the kernel etc. but not restarting it.

### Scan vulnerabilities of non-OS-packages

- Libraries of programming language
- Self-compiled software
- Network Devices

Vuls has some options to detect the vulnerabilities

- [Lockfile based Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#library-vulns-scan)
- [GitHub Integration](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#usage-integrate-with-github-security-alerts)
- [Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) based Scan](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#cpe-scan)
- [OWASP Dependency Check Integration](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html#usage-integrate-with-owasp-dependency-check-to-automatic-update-when-the-libraries-are-updated-experimental)

## Scan WordPress core, themes, plugins

- [Scan WordPress](https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-wordpress.html)

## MISC

- Nondestructive testing
- Pre-authorization is *NOT* necessary before scanning on AWS
  - Vuls works well with Continuous Integration since tests can be run every day. This allows you to find vulnerabilities very quickly.
- Auto-generation of configuration file template
  - Auto-detection of servers set using CIDR, generate configuration file template
- Email and Slack notification is possible (supports Japanese language)
- Scan result is viewable on accessory software, TUI Viewer in a terminal or Web UI ([VulsRepo](https://github.com/ishiDACo/vulsrepo)).

## What Vuls Doesn't Do

- Vuls doesn't update the vulnerable packages.
